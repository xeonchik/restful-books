# RESTful books

This is a sample REST application made as a micro-framework app. This was inspired by Lumen and Silex.

Doctrine ORM integrated because it is well tested and stable object relation mapping system, that very helpful when we want to work with database as objects.

## Installation

Run the Vagrant script:

* `vagrant up`



You can use Doctrine CLI by command
